 # What is a Process

 - A process is essentially reffered to as an instance of a program in execution
  
  - You can think of it as in this way; every time a program runs, it will create the same times it runs corresponding process
 
 - These process are usually controlled by a kernel; The kernel is usually the core interface between a computer hardware and its processes(system call interface)

 - When a process is created, its automatically assigned [a PID](https://github.com/kihuni/Linux_PID_Process_Signals/tree/main/Linux_PIDs)
